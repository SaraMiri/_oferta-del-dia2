## 0. Installation and First Steps

### How to install Node

Since we are using [fish shell](https://fishshell.com/), we need to:

1. Install [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

```
❯ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh | bash
```

2. Install [fish-nvm](https://github.com/FabioAntunes/fish-nvm)

```
❯ fisher add FabioAntunes/fish-nvm
```

3. Install [Node 8](https://nodejs.org/en/) with NVM

```
❯ nvm install 8
❯ node --version
v8.12.0
❯ nvm alias default 8.12.0
```

### How can I sync the project with a remote GitHub repository

```
❯ git remote add origin git@github.com:SaraMiri/oferta-del-dia.git

### 1. Intro to React: notes

- Everything in React is a component!
- A component is a reusable piece of code (a website).
- Webpack is a
- Hot Reloading

### How to declare a component

Both are equivalent

```jsx
class Dave extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <p>"What do you think you are doing, Dave?"</p>;
  }
}
```

```jsx
const Dave = () => {
  return <p>"What do you think you are doing, Dave?"</p>;
};
```

### Component structure

```jsx
// IMPORTS
import React from "react";

// COMPONENT
class Dave extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <p>What do you think you are doing, Dave?</p>;
  }
}

// EXPORT
export default Dave;
```

### To JSX or to not JSX...

#### With only one tag

Both are equivalent

```jsx
<p>What do you think you are doing, Dave?</p>
```

```js
React.createElement("p", {}, "What do you think you are doing, Dave?");
```

#### With nested tags

Both are equivalent

```jsx
<div>
  <p>What do you think you are doing, Dave?</p>
</div>
```

```js
React.createElement(
  "div",
  {},
  React.createElement("p", {}, "What do you think you are doing, Dave?")
);
```

### JSX Gotchas!

#### Use `className` instead of `class`

```jsx
return <p className="my-class">What do you think you are doing, Dave?</p>;
```

#### Beware ASI (Automatic Semicolon Insertion)

If you leave `return` alone in one line a semicolon is automatically inserted! Use `return ( .... )`.

```jsx
return (
  <div>
    <p className="my-class">What do you think you are doing, Dave?</p>
  </div>
);
```
